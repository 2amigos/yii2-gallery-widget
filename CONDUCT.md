# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we 
pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, 
submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level 
of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, 
race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, 
issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. By adopting this Code of Conduct, project 
maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this 
project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the 
project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the 
project or its community in a direct capacity. Personal views, beliefs and values of individuals do not necessarily 
reflect those of the organisation or affiliated individuals and organisations.
